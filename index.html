        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Bryce, and I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional. Welcome to my “About Me” page!</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am a sophomore here at BYU studying--drumroll please--cybersecurity! I just switched into the program over the summer. I was previously pre-mechanical engineering. I'm super stoked
            about cybersecurity, though I have almost no prior knowledge of anything related to it. It's going to be awesome! </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I like to play tennis and pickleball, read, go camping and hiking, and bake. I pretty much love to do anything that involves spending time with family and friends.
            Recently, I've been really into doing CTFs. They're so much fun and have helped me to learn a lot about some relevant technical skills.

        <h2>Religion</h2>
        <p>I am a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I served as a full-time missionary in both Michigan and Brazil. I think it's really a neat opportunity to be able to attend a school where
            spiritual and temporal learning can be combined. It has helped strengthen my testimony of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and their love for me. </strong></p>
